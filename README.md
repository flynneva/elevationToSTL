This project was created to make STL files from USGS elevation data. Other tools are available but I made this to understand the process and to suite my needs better than other methods.

PYTHON REQUIREMENTS:

       NumPy
       GDAL/OGR in Python
       SciPy (for regridding)
       
UNIX REQUIREMENTS
     
       wget
       unzip	
       

Here is an example STL file that I made of Long's Peak in Boulder Colorado.
This image was made using Paraview:
